    "Proud module owner of Share Data Access and Manage Areas of Responsibility Modules. Sub-Rep for Approvals functionality in GHR - Person's team. "+
    "My core responsibilities include developing backend ADF-BC rest services to support VBCS UI and core functionalities across GHR Person Team. "+
    "During my tenure at Oracle, I have led successful transition of Oracle’s HCM flows from the traditional ADF-based UI/Services to the more advanced VBCS (Oracle Visual Builder) based UI/services. This initiative not only streamlined the functionality but also enhanced the user experience of Oracle applications.",
    oracleIntern : "During my internship at Oracle Applications Lab, I’ve made significant contributions to the EZML project. I have automated the Machine Learning platform on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for customer’s convenience. During this period, I’ve also designed and developed micro-services using Apiary and the Spring Boot framework, demonstrating my ability to work with modern development tools and methodologies. Furthermore, I’ve developed proficiency in modern object-oriented programming languages, which not only enhanced my coding skills but also deepened my knowledge of software development. This experience has equipped me with a strong foundation in full-stack development, making me a valuable asset in any software development team."
